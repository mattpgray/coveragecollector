# coveragecollector

A simple go binary for collecting coverage information from multiple packages.

Can outputt:
- The total coverage across the entire codebase
- The coverage of each individual package

Other uses cases can be more easily achieved using the standard tools at the moment

## TODO

- Add support for combining multiple coverage files
